The continuation of the sTab project, which was used for the Ateneo Australs 2008. This is the tab software that will be used for the [Korea Australs 2011](http://www.koreaaustrals2011.com/) and the MMU UADC 2012.

We also offer free hosting of your 3tab debate results at the end of your tournament. So far, we're already hosting results for:
  * [MDO 2012](http://mdo.3tab.org/)
  * [SMU Hammers 2012](http://smuhammers2012.3tab.org/)
  * [MMU UADC 2012](http://mmuuad2012.3tab.org/)

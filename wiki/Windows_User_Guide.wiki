Pro Tip

Sometimes you need to clear symfony's cache before setting changes work (ie changing the score range). Either type “php symfony cc” in your application root folder (but you need to have PHP paths setup properly) or delete all content in the cache folder of your application (go to 3tab/cache - delete everything in) and go back and reload the front page of the app - symfony will recreate the cache pages (http://fabien.potencier.org/article/21/a-symfony-tip-clear-the-cache-without-the-command-line)
